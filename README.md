## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Reusable modular ELT project consisting of building a data warehouse using MySQL, doing transformations using DBT and reporting using redash.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

You can find the live DBT dashboard with generated lineage-graphs at [10academywarehouse.netlify.app](https://10academywarehouse.netlify.app/#!/overview).

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.
<br>

#### Docker
In a linux environment
```
sudo snap install docker
```
Windows or Mac: Get Docker from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

#### Git
Get Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

#### DVC
To load in the data lets install DVC
```
pip install dvc[gdrive]
```

### Installing

Steps that tell you how to get a development env running.

clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Azariagmt/Datawarehouse
```
```
cd Datawarehouse
```
Pull necessary data
```
dvc pull
```
Get mysql, airflow, phpmyadmin and dbt containers up and running
```
docker-compose up
```
Get the reporting dashboard up and running
```
cd redash
```
```
docker-compose up
```


<!-- 

  cd data
  dvc pull

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

* navigate to localhost 5000 to access airflow
* Create connection to running database config with name mysql-connect
* trigger dag to load data into running datawarehouse
* Navigate to localhost 8080 to access phpmyadmin and see if data has been loaded into specified table
